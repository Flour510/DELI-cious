# Welcome to Knuckle Sandwich Co. ðŸ¥ª
In this repository you will find the code written in the Java language that builds a POS for a custom sandwich shop. According to these instructions, the appltication is to be built with these specifications in mind:

- Must make use of OOP concepts
- Must start the project by building a UML diagram
- Customers can order sandwiches in 3 sizes (4", 8" and 12")
- Topping are to be categorized as regular and premium
- Should be able to add drinks and chips
- Must display receipt and total cost to a CSV file when order is complete 

~ Workbook 8 - Capstone 2 (The Deli)

# UML Diagram 
I started with creating a UML diagram to map out what I will need to build my code.

# Interesting Piece of Code
The code I found particularly interesting was creating pushing the receipet to a CSV file. I could not for the life of me figure out how to implement this to my code, until I asked my instrutor. It was as simple as adding a FileWriter and FileReader in a try/catch and then adding a for loop inside of that. 

# Ability to Print Receipt to CSV File
